It contains all my submissions to the competition.

For this competition, we will predict whether a customer made a claim upon an insurance policy. The ground truth claim is binary valued, but a prediction may be any number from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the probability of a claim. The features in this dataset have been anonymized and may contain missing values.
